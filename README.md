# Chess_Game_with_OOP


Scope

Turn-based gameplay: Enforce proper player turns
Piece movement rules: Implements valid movement rules for all chess pieces
Captured piece tracker: Tracks pieces captured by each player
Clear visualization
Check and checkmate
Graphical user interface (GUI)


Significance

Enhances logical thinking and problem-solving skills: Chess is classically recognized as a game that improves cognitive abilities
Integrates technology into classic games
Serves as an educational and training tool: The project can act as a training platform for beginners to test various moves and understand advanced concepts such as castling, en-passant, and checkmate scenarios

Problem
Complex Implementation: Enforcing all chess rules and mechanics, including check and checkmate, is technically challenging for us.
User Interface Design: Even though we are not really sure about the implementation, it requires a clear and intuitive GUI, necessitating careful design and usability testing.
Accuracy in Captured Piece Tracker: Reliable tracking and display of captured pieces are essential for accurate simulation.
Timer and move history tracker: Those two features are necessary but so far we have no a detailed idea about their implementation.
